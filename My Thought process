Dashboard Making Process

# 1. Questioning

- What is the senior management trying to achieve? what is their focus?
- What questions would they have about their sales performance?
- Can I answer them?

To understand what they need, I interviewed a few CEO's I know and asked one single question 'How do you measure your sales performance?' and the pattern I found from all of them was that they start by splitting their revenue, profit and expenses by different categories that matter to their businesses.

I realised my job is to help them oversee such information as if they are looking at a bird's-eye view. Then I started writing down the requirements for success.

My dashboard should

- Provide a fundamental overview of the company's sales. So any CEO can identify the problem at a glance.
- Entail categories they care about.
- Contain minimal filtering options as they will not be interested in too many details yet.

Metrics the CEO would care about 

- **Total Revenue / profit / expenses**
- **Sales volume by location**
- **Revenue by product category**
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ((Sales expense + Marketing expenses) / New customers acquired): Cost required to obtain new customers**
- **~~Customer lifetime value (LTV)~~** = Customer Value x Average Customer lifespan (x): It is misleading to determine the average customer lifespan based on 3 years of data, especially when the bike has 5 years of life-cycle.
- The a**verage revenue per customer**
- Sales % by **New vs existing customer**
- ~~Market penetration rate:~~ Market research data is not available.

# 2. Reviewing Data & Data Cleaning

Tried to understand the relationships between datasets I was given and put them into a model. (*Modelling available)

Ensured there is no duplicated or null columns in datasets.

- Identified Duplicated rows in 'Product_Subcategories' Table

WITH RowNum_CTE AS(
Select *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
PARTITION BY productSubcategoryKey,
SubcategoryName,
ProductCategoryKey
ORDER BY ProductSubcategoryKey) row_num

FROM [NAB Job assessment].dbo.Product_Subcategories$)

DELETE
FROM RowNum_CTE
WHERE row_num > 1

# 3. Data Wrangling to get the following metrics

- **Total Revenue / profit / expenses**
- **Sales volume by location**
- **Best-selling product category**
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ((Sales expense + Marketing expenses) / New customers acquired)**
- **Average revenue per account / product / customer**
- **% of Revenue from new vs existing customer**
- **Product Return rate**
